# Class-Inheritance

Welcome to this class inheritance project, which shows how class inhertiance works by giving an example.

The Animal class has 2 subclasses: Fish and Zebra. The "extends" keyword is used to make these subclasses of the Animal class.
There is a main function running within the Animal class that calls all methods--note that it cannot call private methods, even if we try to.

The project should output:
"This animal is a mammal."
"This animal has found a mate."
"The zebra is running."

Notice how "The fish is eating" was not printed out due to it being part of the Fish class, which is private.
